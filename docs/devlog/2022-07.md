## Tic-tac-toe tutorial

The first project of this playground will be a tic-tac-toe built following this
tutorial : [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

The tutorial was pretty easy to follow. I still made some changes to how the whole project was organized so that I could
follow a more complex and professional I guess method.
I also implemented styles using React instead of using normal CSS.

## Github Pages

https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages  
`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

Spent a lot of time trying to understand how it works but in fact I was just creating more mess.

You just need to run `npm run deploy -- -m message` and all the changes will be updated on the Github Pages but be careful because it 
can take quite a lot of time to do so.

## Tic-tac-toe : Going Further

At the end of the tutorial there are some upgrades listed. I'll try to implement them.

- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [X] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [X] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.   
- [X] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [X] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

Here are the functionalities that I want to add :

1. Time travel the game using the left and right arrows
