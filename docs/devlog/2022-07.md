# July 2022

The first project of this playground will be a tic-tac-toe built following this
tutorial : [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## Tic-tac-toe

The tutorial was pretty easy to follow.

## Github Pages

https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages  
`npm install gh-pages --save-dev`

Spent a lot of time trying to understand how it works but in fact I was just creating more mess.

You just need to run `npm run deploy -- -m message` and all the changes will be updated on the Github Pages but be careful because it 
can take quite a lot of time to do so.
